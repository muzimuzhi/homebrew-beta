# Homebrew tap `muzimuzhi/beta`

Due to too few downloads, on 5 May 2020, cask `texstudio-beta` (2.12.22beta2) was [removed] from [`homebrew-cask-version`][homebrew-cask-version], the official repo for pre-release casks.

So there is this homebrew tap.

## Quick actions

```bash
# installation
# note that `texstudio-beta` conflicts with `texstudio`
brew install muzimuzhi/beta/texstudio-beta

# formula upgrading
brew bump-formula-pr muzimuzhi/beta/FORMULA --version=VERSION [--write-only]

# cask upgrading
brew bump-cask-pr muzimuzhi/beta/CASK --version=VERSION [--write-only]

# check out latest tap workflows
brew tap-new --github-packages --no-git USER/REPO
```
