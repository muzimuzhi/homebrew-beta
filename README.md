# Homebrew tap texstudio-beta

Due to too few downloads, on 5 May 2020, cask `texstudio-beta` (2.12.22beta2) was [removed] from [`homebrew-cask-version`][homebrew-cask-version], the official repo for pre-release casks. 

So there is this homebrew tap.

## Installation

  - `brew install muzimuzhi/texstudio-beta/texstudio-beta`
  - or `brew tap muzimuzhi/texstudio-beta` and then `brew install texstudio-beta`.

Note: `texstudio-beta` conflicts with `texstudio`, so you may need to run `brew uninstall texstudio` before installing `texstudio-beta`.

## Upgrading a formula

Run ([doc](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#bump-cask-pr-options-cask))
```bash
brew bump-formula-pr muzimuzhi/texstudio-beta/<formula> --version=<version>
```

Or, through manual steps:

- Update version
- Open a PR
- After checks check, label PR with `pr-pull` label
- @github-actions bot will update bottles then merge commits in PR
